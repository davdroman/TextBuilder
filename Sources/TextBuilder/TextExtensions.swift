extension StringProtocol {
	/// Turns any `StringProtocol` (like `String` or `Substring`) into a SwiftUI `Text`.
	///
	/// In this package, itâ€™s a small convenience for the moments when you actually need a `Text`:
	/// to chain `Text`-only modifiers or to pass a `Text` to an API, even though inside builders
	/// you can drop raw strings directly. Using `.text` keeps things tidy and avoids sprinkling
	/// `Text(...)` everywhere.
	///
	/// ## Example
	/// ```swift
	/// @TextBuilder(separator: " ")
	/// func message() -> Text {
	///     "Hello"
	///     "world".text.bold()
	/// }
	/// ```
	///
	/// This is equivalent to `Text(self)` and produces verbatim text.

	}
}

extension Sequence<Text> {
	/// Returns a new `Text` by concatenating the elements of the sequence.
	///
	/// If the sequence is empty, it returns nil.
	///
	/// The following example shows how an array of `Text` views can be joined to a
	/// single `Text` view with comma-separated string:
	///
	///     let cast = [Text("Vivien"), Text("Marlon"), Text("Kim")]
	///     let list = cast.joined(separator: Text(", "))
	///     // Gives Text("Vivien, Marlon, Kim")
	///
	/// - Parameter separator: A `Text` view to insert between each of the elements
	///   in this sequence. By default there is no separator.
	/// - Returns: A single, concatenated `Text` view, or `nil` if the sequence
	///   is empty.

	///     By default there is no separator.
